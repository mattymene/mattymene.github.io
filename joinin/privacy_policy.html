In the context of the purposes described in this document, JoinIn may use User Data to make decisions based entirely or partially on automated processes.
JoinIn resorts to automated decision-making processes insofar as it is necessary to conclude or execute a contract between User and Controller or, if required by law, with the User's consent.<br/>
Automated decision-making processes depend on technological tools provided by the Controller or by third parties and are generally based on algorithms that respond to predefined criteria.
The logic underlying automated decision-making processes aims to:</p>

<ul>
<li>allow or improve the decision-making process;</li>
<li>ensure fair and unbiased treatment of Users;</li>
<li>reduce the potential damage resulting from human error, personal bias or other similar circumstances that may lead to discrimination or imbalance in the treatment of individuals;</li>

<h3>Effects of Automated Decision-Making Processes and Rights of Users Subject to Them</h3>

  Legal Basis for Processing

<p>The Controller processes Personal Data relating to the User in case one of the following conditions exists:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the User has given consent for specific purposes.</li>
  <li>processing is necessary for the execution of a contract with the User and/or for the execution of pre-contractual measures;</li>
  <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Controller is subject;</li>
  <li>processing is necessary for the execution of a public task or for the exercise of public powers invested in the Controller;</li>
  <li>processing is necessary for the pursuit of the Controller's legitimate interest or that of third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is always possible to request the Controller to clarify the concrete legal basis of each processing and, in particular, to specify whether the processing is based on law, on a contract or necessary to conclude a contract.</p>


  <h3 class="">
  Further Information on the Retention Period
</h3>

<p>If not otherwise indicated in this document, Personal Data are processed and stored for the time required by the purpose for which they were collected and may be stored for a longer period due to legal obligations or on the basis of Users' consent. </p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the execution of a contract between the Controller and the User will be retained until such contract has been completed.</li>
  <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the legitimate interest of the Controller will be retained until such interest has been satisfied. The User can obtain further information on the legitimate interest pursued by the Controller in the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Controller.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the processing is based on consent of the User, the Controller may retain Personal Data for a longer period until such consent is revoked. In addition, the Controller may be required to retain Personal Data for a longer period to comply with a legal obligation or order from an authority.<br /><br />At the end of the retention period, Personal Data will be deleted. Therefore, at the expiration of such period, the right to access, deletion, rectification and the right to portability of Data will no longer be exercisable.</p>


  <h3 id="rights_subjects">Users' Rights with Respect to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
<p>Users can exercise certain rights with respect to the Data processed by the Controller.</p>
