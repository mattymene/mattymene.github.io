<p>The suspension or deletion of an account for reasons attributable to the User does not exempt the User from paying any applicable fees or prices.</p>

<!-- ===================== CONTENT ===================== -->
<h3 id="content-on-joinin">Content on JoinIn</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise specified or clearly recognizable, all content available on JoinIn is owned or provided by the Owner or its licensors.</p>
<p>
    The Owner takes the utmost care to ensure that the content available on JoinIn does not violate applicable law or third-party rights. However, it is not always possible to achieve such a result.<br>In such cases, without prejudice to any legally enforceable rights and claims, Users are kindly requested to address their complaints to the contact details specified in this document.
</p>
<h4 id="rights-regarding-content-of-joinin">Rights regarding content of JoinIn</h4>
<p>The Owner holds and expressly reserves all intellectual property rights on the aforementioned content.</p>
<p>Users are not authorized to use the content in any way that is not necessary or implicit in the proper use of the Service.</p>
<p>In particular, but without limitation, Users are prohibited from copying, downloading, sharing beyond the limits specified below, modifying, translating, processing, publishing, transmitting, selling, sublicensing, transforming, transferring/assigning to third parties or creating derivative works from the content available on JoinIn, or allowing third parties to undertake such activities through their User account or device, even without their knowledge.</p>
<p>Where expressly indicated on JoinIn, Users are authorized to download, copy and/or share certain content available on JoinIn exclusively for personal and non-commercial purposes and provided that the attribution of authorship of the work and any other relevant circumstance required by the Owner is observed.</p>
<p>The limitations and exclusions provided by copyright law remain unaffected.</p>
<h3 id="content-provided-by-users">Content provided by Users</h3>
<p>The Owner allows Users to upload, share or provide their own content to JoinIn.</p>
<p>By providing content to JoinIn, Users declare that they are legally authorized to do so and confirm that such content does not violate any law or third-party rights.</p>
<h4 id="rights-regarding-content-provided-by-users">Rights regarding content provided by Users</h4>
<p>Users acknowledge and accept that by providing their own content to JoinIn, they grant the Owner a non-exclusive right to process the content for the purposes of operation and maintenance of JoinIn, as contractually required.</p>
<p>To the extent permitted by law, Users waive any moral rights in relation to the content provided to JoinIn.</p>
<p>Users acknowledge and accept that the content they provide through JoinIn will be made available under the same conditions applicable to JoinIn's content.</p>
<p>Users are solely responsible for content uploaded, posted, shared or otherwise provided to JoinIn.</p>
<p>Users acknowledge and accept that the Owner filters or moderates such content after it has been made available.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Owner reserves the right to refuse, remove, delete or block such content at its own discretion and to deny access to JoinIn without prior notice to the User who uploaded it if it deems that the content violates these Terms, applicable law or third-party rights or otherwise represents a risk to Users, third parties, the Owner itself or the availability of the Service.</p>
<p>The removal, deletion or blocking of content does not justify any claim for compensation, reimbursement or indemnity by Users who have provided such content.</p>
<p>Users agree to hold the Owner harmless from and against any claim asserted and/or damage suffered due to content they provided to or offered through JoinIn.</p>
<h4 id="removal-of-content-from-joinin-available-through-app-store">Removal of content from JoinIn available through App Store</h4>
<p>If a content subject to complaint is considered contestable, it will be removed within 24 hours and the User responsible for the upload will be denied access to the Service.</p>
<h3 id="access-to-external-resources">Access to external resources</h3>
<p>Through JoinIn, Users may have access to external resources provided by third parties. Users acknowledge and accept that the Owner has no control over such resources and therefore is not responsible for their content and availability.</p>
<p>The conditions applicable to resources provided by third parties, including those applicable to any possible grant of rights on content, are determined by said third parties and regulated in the relevant terms and conditions or, in their absence, by law.</p>
<p>In particular, on JoinIn, Users may encounter advertisements provided by third parties. The Owner does not control or moderate the advertisements displayed through JoinIn. By clicking on any such advertisement, Users will interact with the third party responsible for the advertisement.</p>
<p>The Owner is not responsible for what may result from such interaction with third parties, access to third-party sites or the use of third-party content.</p>
<h3 id="permitted-use">Permitted use</h3>
<p>JoinIn and the Service may only be used for the purposes for which they are offered, according to these Terms and applicable law.</p>
<p>It is the User's sole responsibility to ensure that the use of JoinIn and/or the Service does not violate the law, regulations or third-party rights.</p>
<p>
    Therefore, <strong>the Owner reserves the right to take any appropriate measure to protect its legitimate interests, and in particular to deny the User access to JoinIn or the Service, terminate contracts, report any censurable activity carried out through JoinIn or the Service to the competent authorities – such as judicial or administrative authorities – whenever the User engages or is suspected to engage in:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>violations of laws, regulations and/or the Terms;</li>
    <li>infringement of third-party rights;</li>
    <li>acts that may considerably prejudice the Owner's legitimate interests;</li>
    <li>offenses to the Owner or to a third party.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Treat others with respect</li>

<h3 id="provision-of-personal-data">Provision of personal data</h3>

<h3 id="paid-products">Paid Products</h3>
<p>Some of the Products offered on JoinIn as part of the Service are paid.</p>
<p>The fees, duration and conditions applicable to the sale of such Products are described below and in the respective sections of JoinIn.</p>
<h3 id="product-description">Product Description</h3>
<p>Prices, descriptions and availability of Products are specified in the respective sections of JoinIn and are subject to change without notice.</p>
<p>Although Products on JoinIn are presented with the greatest accuracy technically possible, representation on JoinIn through any means (including, as the case may be, graphic material, images, colors, sounds) is for reference only and implies no warranty as to the characteristics of the purchased Product.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the selected Product will be outlined during the purchasing process.</p>
<p>
    <strong>The offer of Products is non-binding. To make a purchase, Users must make a binding offer to purchase. Only once such offer is accepted, the contract can be considered concluded.</strong>
</p>
<h3 id="purchase-procedure">Purchase Procedure</h3>
<p>Each step, from choosing the product to submitting the order, is part of the purchase procedure.</p>
<p>The purchase procedure includes these steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Users are asked to choose the desired Product and verify their purchase selection.</li>
    <li>After having reviewed the information visible in the purchase selection, Users may place the order by submitting it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="order-submission">Order Submission</h3>
<p>When the User submits an order, the following applies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.</li>
    <li>In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of personal information or specifications, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.</li>
    <li>Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been received.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="order-confirmation">Order Confirmation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Unless the receipt of order constitutes express acceptance of the order – in which case the contract is to be considered concluded – the purchase contract is concluded at the moment the User receives the communication of order acceptance.</li>
    <li>Subject to availability and at the Owner's discretion, the order shall be accepted without undue delay.</li>
</ul>
<p>The failure to accept an order does not give the User any right to make claims against the Owner – including compensation – of any kind.</p>
<p>All notifications related to the described purchase procedure will be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.</p>
<h3 id="prices">Prices</h3>
<p>During the purchase process and before order submission, Users are duly informed of all fees, taxes and costs (including any possible shipping costs) that will be charged to them.</p>
<p>Prices on JoinIn:</p>
<ul>
    <li>include all applicable fees, taxes and costs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="promotions-and-discounts">Promotions and Discounts</h3>
<p>The Owner may offer discounts or special promotions for the purchase of Products. Such promotions or discounts shall always be subject to the requirements and terms and conditions set out in the relevant section of JoinIn.</p>
<p>Promotions and offers are always granted at the Owner's sole discretion.</p>
<p>Repeated or periodic promotions or discounts do not create any claim or right that Users may enforce in the future.</p>
<p>Depending on the case, discounts and promotions shall be valid for a limited time or while stocks last. Unless otherwise specified, the time limitations of promotions and discounts shall refer to the time zone of the Owner's registered office, as indicated in the contact details in this document.</p>
<h3 id="vouchers">Vouchers</h3>
<p>Promotions and discounts may be offered in the form of Vouchers.</p>
<p>In case of breach of the conditions applicable to Vouchers, the Owner may legitimately refuse to fulfill its contractual obligations and expressly reserves the right to take appropriate legal action to protect its rights and interests.</p>
<p>Any additional or diverging provisions applicable to the use of the Vouchers indicated in the relevant information page or on the Voucher itself shall always prevail, regardless of the provisions below.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, the following rules apply to the use of Vouchers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each Voucher is valid only if used according to the methods and within the time period specified on the website and/or on the Voucher;</li>
    <li>The Voucher can only be redeemed in full at the time of purchase – partial use is not permitted;</li>
    <li>Unless otherwise specified, single-use Vouchers may be redeemed only once per purchase and may therefore be redeemed only once even in case of installment purchases;</li>
    <li>Vouchers cannot be combined;</li>
    <li>The Voucher must be used within the validity period specified. After expiry, the Voucher will be automatically cancelled. Any possibility of claiming rights, including reimbursement of the Voucher's value, is excluded;</li>
    <li>The User is not entitled to any credit/refund/compensation if there is a difference between the value of the Voucher and the value redeemed;</li>
    <li>The Voucher is intended for non-commercial use only. Reproduction, counterfeiting and marketing of the Voucher are strictly prohibited, as well as any illegal activity related to the purchase and/or use of the Voucher.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="methods-of-payment">Methods of Payment</h3>
<p>Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.</p>
<p>Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees. Detailed information is provided in the relevant section of JoinIn.</p>
<p>All payments are independently processed through third-party services. Therefore, JoinIn does not collect any payment information – such as credit card details – but receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed. For further information, Users may refer to JoinIn's privacy policy.</p>
<p>If payment through the available methods fail or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner is not obliged to execute the order. In case of failed payment, the Owner reserves the right to request the User to pay any expenses or damages incurred.</p>
<h3 id="authorization-for-future-paypal-payment">Authorization for future PayPal payment</h3>
<p>If Users authorize the PayPal feature which allows future purchases, JoinIn will store an identification code linked to the Users' PayPal account. This will authorize JoinIn to automatically process payments for future purchases or recurring installments of past purchases.</p>
<p>This authorization can be revoked at any time, either by contacting the Owner or by changing the relevant PayPal account settings.</p>
<h3 id="retention-of-product-usage-rights">Retention of Product usage rights</h3>
<p>Users do not acquire any rights to use the purchased Product until the total purchase price is received by the Owner.</p>
<h3 id="delivery">Delivery</h3>
<h4 id="performance-of-services">Performance of services</h4>
<p>The purchased service shall be performed or made available within the timeframe specified on JoinIn or as communicated before the order submission.</p>
<h2 id="limitation-of-liability-and-indemnification">Limitation of liability and indemnification</h2>
<p>Unless otherwise explicitly stated and without prejudice to applicable law, the Owner's liability for damages in connection with the execution of the Agreement shall be excluded, limited and/or reduced to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
<h4 id="indemnification">Indemnification</h4>
<p>The User agrees to indemnify and hold the Owner and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners and employees harmless from and against any claim or demand – including without limitation, reasonable legal fees and costs – made by any third party due to or in relation with any culpable use of or connection to the Service, violation of these Terms, infringement of any third-party rights or statutory provision by the User or its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners and employees to the extent allowed by applicable law.</p>
<p>The above also applies to any claims asserted by third parties (including, by way of example, the Owner's customers) against the Owner in relation to Digital Products provided by the User, such as, for example, claims regarding conformity.</p>
<h4 id="limitation-of-liability-for-user-activities-on-joinin">Limitation of liability for User activities on JoinIn</h4>
<p>Unless otherwise explicitly stated and without prejudice to applicable law, Users shall have no right to claim damages against the Owner (or any natural or legal person acting on its behalf).</p>
<p>This does not apply to damages to life, health or physical integrity, damages resulting from the breach of an essential contractual obligation such as any obligation strictly necessary to achieve the purpose of the contract, and/or damages resulting from intent or gross negligence, as long as JoinIn has been appropriately and correctly used by the User.</p>
<p>Unless damages have been caused by way of intent or gross negligence, or they affect life, health or physical integrity, the Owner shall only be liable to the extent of typical and foreseeable damages at the moment of contract execution and as far as these are not excluded or limited as per above.</p>
<h3 id="australian-users">Australian Users</h3>
<h4 id="limitation-of-liability">Limitation of Liability</h4>
<p>Nothing in these Terms excludes, limits or modifies any guarantee, condition, indemnity, right or remedy which the User may have under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) or any similar State and Territory legislation and which cannot be excluded, limited or modified (non-excludable right). To the fullest extent permitted by law, our liability to the User, including liability for a breach of a non-excludable right and liability which is not otherwise excluded under these Terms and Conditions, is limited, at the Owner's sole discretion, to the re-performance of the services or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.</p>

</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Owner does not warrant, endorse, guarantee or assume responsibility for any product or service advertised or offered by a third party through the Service or any hyperlinked website or service, and the Owner shall not be a party to or in any way monitor any transaction between Users and third-party providers of products or services.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Service may become inaccessible or it may not function properly with the User's web browser, mobile device, and/or operating system. The Owner cannot be held liable for any perceived or actual damages arising from Service content, operation or use of this Service.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Federal law, some states, and other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties. The above exclusions may not apply to Users.

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, resulting from or relating to the use of, or inability to use, the Service; and</strong>

<h2 id="common-provisions">Common Provisions</h2>
<h3 id="no-waiver">No Waiver</h3>
